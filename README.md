## Task and Requirements

### Task:
The goal of this project was to analyze weekly revenue and cohort data to understand patterns in customer behavior and revenue growth over time. We aimed to visualize and interpret the following metrics:
1. Weekly Average Revenue by Cohorts
2. Cumulative Revenue by Cohorts
3. Revenue Prediction by Cohorts

The task also required providing actionable insights and recommendations for improving revenue across cohorts.

### Results:
- The cohort starting on 2020-11-29 (week 5) has the highest total registrations at 28,069. This surge may indicate a successful marketing campaign or a seasonal effect leading to a larger pool of potential customers.
- There is a significant drop in revenue from week 0 to week 1 across most cohorts. For example: The 2020-12-06 cohort shows a drop from $1.3069 to $0.3294. The 2020-11-22 cohort shows a drop from $1.6472 to $0.2359.
- The consistent pattern of revenue decay across weeks suggests that most customers tend to make a purchase shortly after registration and then quickly disengage.
- The 2020-11-29 cohort, despite having the highest initial registration, follows a similar long-term revenue pattern as other cohorts, indicating that more registrations do not necessarily equate to longer-term value.
- Earlier cohorts (e.g., November 2020) generally perform better over the 12-week span compared to later cohorts (e.g., January 2021). This suggests a change in customer behavior, marketing strategy, or external factors affecting customer retention and spending habits.
---

### Key Findings:
- High registration numbers do not guarantee long-term revenue.
- A sharp drop in revenue after the first week is observed across all cohorts, indicating a need for improved customer retention strategies.
- Earlier cohorts tend to perform better, possibly due to more effective initial marketing or customer engagement efforts
---
### Recommendations:
- Improve customer retention: Develop strategies that keep customers engaged beyond the first purchase, such as personalized follow-up emails or loyalty programs.
- Refine marketing campaigns: Investigate what led to the surge in registrations for the 2020-11-29 cohort and explore ways to replicate that success for future cohorts.
- Analyze cohort performance: Investigate differences between earlier and later cohorts, focusing on marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer behavior changes over time.
- Focus on long-term value: More emphasis should be placed on nurturing early customers to increase the long-term value per customer, rather than focusing solely on attracting large numbers of registrations.

## 2. Cumulative Revenue by Cohorts (USD)

### Results:
- **Cumulative growth percentages** indicate a steady decline in growth rates from Week 1 (23.29%) to Week 12 (1.18%). This is expected, as the initial weeks after registration tend to see the most significant revenue impact, with diminishing returns over time.
  
- **High Initial Growth (Weeks 0-3)**: The highest cumulative growth is observed in the first few weeks, particularly from Week 0 to Week 3. For example:
  - The November 1st, 2020 cohort shows significant growth from **$0.9380** in Week 0 to **$1.7933** by Week 3.
  - This indicates that the initial weeks after a user's first visit are crucial for revenue generation, suggesting effective engagement during this early period.

- **Deceleration After Week 3**: Starting from Week 4, the growth rate begins to decelerate. For instance:
  - The November 1st cohort grows from **$1.7933** in Week 3 to **$1.9532** in Week 4, a smaller increase compared to the previous weeks.
  - This pattern is consistent across most cohorts, indicating a common trend where users' spending or engagement starts to taper off after the initial few weeks.

- **Weeks 5-6 as Critical Growth Points**: Weeks 5 and 6 show a small but noticeable growth bump for most cohorts. For example:
  - The November 8th cohort jumps from **$2.1064** in Week 5 to **$2.2717** in Week 6.
  - This highlights that while the growth rate is slower, it is still an important period for driving cumulative revenue. Cohorts that manage to sustain growth through these weeks, particularly those in early November, tend to maintain higher cumulative revenues overall.

- **Plateauing Growth (Weeks 10-12)**: By Week 10, the growth rate has largely plateaued, with very minimal increases in cumulative revenue. For example:
  - The November 1st cohort grows from **$2.3564** in Week 11 to **$2.3746** in Week 12.
  - This indicates that most revenue from this cohort has already been realized by Week 10, and after this, additional revenue growth is minimal. This plateau suggests that after 10 weeks, users are less likely to contribute significantly to additional revenue, marking this as a point where re-engagement strategies might be necessary.
---
### Key Findings:
- **Highest Growth Rate**: The highest cumulative growth rates are observed between Weeks 0 to 3, where users are most active and engaged.
- **Lowest Growth Rate**: The lowest growth rates are observed from Week 8 onwards, where cumulative revenue growth almost stagnates.
- **Critical Weeks**: Weeks 5 and 6 emerge as critical periods where maintaining growth momentum can lead to higher cumulative revenues.
---
### Recommendations:
- **Focus on Early Engagement**: Since the initial weeks show the highest growth, prioritize strategies that drive engagement in the first few weeks post-registration. This can include targeted promotions, onboarding, and personalized messaging to keep users active.
- **Retain Momentum in Weeks 5-6**: Identify ways to drive further engagement during Weeks 5 and 6, where there is still noticeable growth. This period may benefit from special offers or updates that rekindle user interest.
- **Re-engagement Strategies After Week 10**: By Week 10, growth plateaus, suggesting that users may need to be re-engaged to continue generating additional revenue. Implementing re-engagement campaigns like reminders or loyalty incentives might help revitalize dormant users.
- **Monitor for User Fatigue**: Given the deceleration in growth after Week 3 and plateauing by Week 10, closely monitor customer behavior to avoid fatigue and ensure that the product or service remains valuable and engaging over time.

## 3. Revenue Prediction by Cohorts (USD)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dc93d69-28cf-4864-944a-815ae41788f9)

### Results:
- **Strong Early Performance**: The strongest revenue in the cohorts was observed during the first five weeks. For instance, the cohort from **2020-11-01** started with **$0.9380** in Week 0 and reached **$2.3746** by Week 12. This cohort maintained robust performance throughout the period.

- **Top Performing Cohort**: The **2020-11-08 cohort** shows consistently high growth, reaching **$2.6727** by Week 12, making it the top-performing cohort. This indicates a strong retention rate and engagement over time.

- **Lower Engagement Cohort**: The **2021-01-24 cohort** predicts a revenue of **$0.3502** by Week 12, reflecting the lowest overall engagement or a smaller user value cohort.

- **Overall Revenue Growth**: From Week 0 to Week 12, the average revenue increased from **$0.8554** to **$1.4708**, representing an overall growth of **71.96%**.
---
### Conclusions:
- **Retention and Revenue Growth**: The earlier cohorts demonstrate better retention and higher revenue growth, which could be attributed to more effective marketing strategies, better onboarding experiences, or higher quality of users acquired during these periods.

- **Predictive Decline**: Revenue predictions across cohorts show a general decline, particularly in the later weeks, indicating that the initial burst of engagement typically wanes over time.
---
### Actionable Insights:
- **User Acquisition and Engagement**: For recent cohorts that show lower cumulative revenue, it may be worth revisiting user acquisition and engagement strategies to identify areas for improvement. Specific focus on **Weeks 5 and 6** could help in boosting cumulative revenue during this critical period.
  
- **Cost of Acquisition**: Given that the average cost of acquiring a customer is **$2**, while the average revenue per customer stands at **$1.47**, it is imperative to reassess marketing strategies and the allocation of resources dedicated to customer acquisition campaigns.
---
### Recommendations:
1. **Revisit User Acquisition Strategies**: Focus on improving the quality of acquired users, particularly for newer cohorts that are showing weaker performance.
2. **Enhance Retention Programs**: Consider developing strategies to maintain customer engagement after the first few weeks. Early engagement may be key to long-term success.
3. **Focus on Weeks 5-6**: Cohorts that maintain revenue growth through Weeks 5-6 tend to show stronger long-term performance. Targeted engagement during this time may improve revenue outcomes.
4. **Review Marketing Spend**: With the current average cost of acquisition higher than revenue per customer, the marketing strategies and resource allocation need to be optimized for better efficiency.

---

### Next Steps:
- Implement the recommendations for underperforming cohorts.
- Regularly track the performance of cohorts and adjust strategies as necessary.
- Continue to refine predictive models to improve forecast accuracy.
