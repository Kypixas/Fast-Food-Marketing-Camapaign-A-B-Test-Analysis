# A/B Test Analysis for Fast Food Marketing Campaigns

This repository contains an analysis of an A/B test dataset from the **turing_data_analytics** project, specifically focusing on the **wa_marketing_campaign** dataset. The analysis compares the performance of three different marketing campaigns to determine which one drives the most sales for a fast-food chain.

## Goal of the Test

The objective of this A/B test is to identify which marketing campaign (out of three) performs best in driving sales across different locations. By aggregating the data by **LocationID** and **PromotionID**, we ensure that the comparisons between campaigns are consistent and reliable.

## Target Metric

The dataset provides three key variables:

- **LocationID**: Identifies individual shop locations, with each unique **LocationID** corresponding to a distinct store.
- **PromotionID**: Specifies which promotional campaign was implemented at each location.
- **Sales_in_thousands**: Represents the revenue generated by each location under the respective promotion, measured in thousands of dollars.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following metrics for each promotion:

| Promotion | Total Locations | Total Sum (Sales in Thousands) | Mean Sales | Standard Deviation (STDEV) | Variance |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------|----------------------------|----------|
| 1         | 43              | 9993.03                       | 232.40     | 64.11                      | 4110.46  |
| 2         | 47              | 8897.93                       | 189.32     | 57.99                      | 3362.65  |
| 3         | 47              | 10408.52                      | 221.46     | 65.54                      | 4294.90  |

## Statistical Tests & Results

Pairwise t-tests were conducted to compare the sales performance between each pair of campaigns. The significance of each test is determined using a **99% confidence level** to account for the multiple testing problem. Below are the results:

### 1. Promotion 1 vs Promotion 2:
- **p-value**: 0.0012
- **Conclusion**: The p-value is much lower than 0.01, indicating a statistically significant difference between the sales of Promotion 1 and Promotion 2. **Promotion 1 outperforms Promotion 2** and should be recommended for launch.

### 2. Promotion 1 vs Promotion 3:
- **p-value**: 0.4264
- **Conclusion**: Since the p-value is greater than 0.01, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating no significant difference between the sales generated by Promotion 1 and Promotion 3. **Promotion 3 should not replace Promotion 1**, as there is no evidence that it drives higher sales.

### 3. Promotion 2 vs Promotion 3:
- **p-value**: 0.0135
- **Conclusion**: Although the p-value is less than 0.05, it does not meet the more stringent 99% confidence threshold (0.01). Therefore, at a 99% confidence level, there is insufficient evidence to prefer one campaign over the other. **Further testing** may be necessary to better understand the impact of these promotions.

## Recommendations

- **Promotion 1 vs. Promotion 2**: With a highly significant p-value (0.0012), **Promotion 1** should be launched, as it outperforms Promotion 2.
- **Promotion 1 vs. Promotion 3**: Since the p-value (0.4264) is not statistically significant, **Promotion 3 should not be considered** as an alternative to Promotion 1.
- **Promotion 2 vs. Promotion 3**: Further testing is required to confidently choose between Promotions 2 and 3, as the p-value (0.0135) does not meet the stricter confidence level threshold.

## Conclusion

- **Promotion 1** is the best-performing campaign, as it shows a statistically significant increase in sales compared to Promotion 2.
- **Promotion 3** does not demonstrate a significant improvement over Promotion 1, so it is not recommended.
- Further tests could be conducted between Promotions 2 and 3 to ensure the most effective marketing strategy.
